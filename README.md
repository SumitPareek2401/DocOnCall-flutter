An Android Application in which users can directly interact with doctors by booking appointment. Authentication is done using Gmail or OTP. Firebase Services like Realtime Database, Firestore, Storage and Authentication are used. 

When users start the application first splash screen appears then a login/signup screen appears which uses firebase service of Authentication and also phone number OTP used for authentication. After that home screen appears which has a simple but nice UI designed by me. 

Users can also fill medical form at their home by using their smartphone. And these details are to be stored in Realtime Database which is provided by Firebase. 
Users can also access nearby best doctors and directly contact with them by using Google Maps. Google Map API keys are used for Google Maps. And also users can chat with doctors for their directly advice.
